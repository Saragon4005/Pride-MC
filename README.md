# Installing

This pack uses [unsup](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/unsup) to manage its versions. 
Installing unsup is very easy, simply download the latest (stable) unsup from the [offical releases](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed/unsup/releases) (1.1.6 at the time of writing) into your minecraft directory
as well as the unsup.ini file found above and then add -javaagent:unsup-1.1.6.jar (make sure this is the same name as the .jar file) to your JVM arguments in your launcher 

In Prism Launcher, its even easier as you just need to import the .json file found in relases into your components or simply import the attached zip. the unsup.ini file still needs to be placed in the minecraft folder however
